# Responsibility Gate – Pre-Execution Authority Layer


Pre-execution authority control layer for AI-assisted decisions.

## Core Principle

No high-impact automated decision executes without named human responsibility.

This system enforces a binding rule:
High-risk actions require explicit human authorization before execution.

---

## What It Demonstrates

• Risk-based gating  
• Named authority binding  
• Execution control before action  
• Audit logging with timestamps  

This is not a dashboard.
This is not a compliance checklist.
This is an execution control layer.

---

## Basic Flow

AI → submits decision  
System → classifies risk  
High-risk → status = pending  
Human → authorizes with name  
Only then → execution allowed  

---
This prototype demonstrates enforcement of named human authority 
before execution of high-impact AI decisions. 

It is not a dashboard.
It is not a compliance checklist.
It is an execution control layer.

## Why This Matters for Democratic AI

Modern AI systems increasingly execute high-impact decisions under conditions of partial context, delegation, and automation. In many architectures, responsibility is assumed, inferred, or reconstructed after execution.

This creates a structural gap: decisions may be operationally valid while remaining institutionally unbound.

Responsibility Gate addresses this gap by enforcing named human authority before execution  not as policy documentation, but as a runtime requirement.

By binding scope, identity, and authorization to the execution path, the system prevents responsibility from collapsing into heuristic continuation under degraded or concurrent conditions.
